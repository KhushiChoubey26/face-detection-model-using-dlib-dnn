# Face-detection-model-using-dlib-dnn
Face detection is a computer vision task that allows a program to detect a human face in a photo or video. Face detection can help embellish selfies and portraits or produce virtual avatars from a user's photo. In this project, we’ll learn to detect the faces in a photo using dlib and DNN in OpenCV.

# Project Description
Face detection is one of the most fundamental aspects of computer vision.

I’ll use:

Frontal face detector dlib: Dlib is a C++ toolbox for employing machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Despite being built in C++, it includes Python bindings executed in Python. The dlib frontal face detector extracts feature using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and then processes using an SVM.

Caffe model with DNN from OpenCV: The Caffe model is based on the Single Shot-Multibox Detector (SSD) that uses the ResNet-10 architecture. It was added to OpenCV’s deep neural network module after version 3.3.
